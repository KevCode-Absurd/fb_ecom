The problem is, that many eCommerce businesses have no idea where to start. They’re not sure which strategies to implement, where to focus their ad spend, or how to create an ad in the first place! But in today’s post, we’re going to share seven effectiveFacebook Ads strategiesfor eCommerce to help you get your campaign off the ground.We’re going to start off with a bang and dive right into the seven can’t-missstrategies eCommerce marketersneed to implement for their Facebook Ads today.Social Media eCommerce Marketing To Boost Sales & EngagementWatch this video on YouTube1. Use dynamic product adsDynamic product ads are a feature on Facebook Ads you can’t afford to not take advantage of! If you sell a large number of items in your eCommerce store, this feature will be invaluable to you. It uses machine learning to show unique products to each user based on their specific interests, activities, and demographics. So, rather than setting up thousands of separate ads, dynamic ads help you accomplish the same goal with a single ad set.Are you already using the catalog sales objective? Then you’re also using dynamic ads—even if you didn’t realize it!But take a look at what Facebook says about dynamic ads and the targeting options available to users:Dynamic ads for broad audiences reach consumers who have not yet purchased from your business or visited your website but may have shown interest in the types of products or services you are offering.Dynamic ads for retargeting reach consumers who have expressed interest in specific products on your website or app and encourage them to complete the action.Benefits of dynamic adsNow, if you’re still not convinced dynamic ads are a must-have, take a look at these four benefits:They are personalized:The beauty of dynamic ads is that they are just that: dynamic! This means they automatically deliver relevant content to consumers based on their unique behaviors and interests.Always on:You’ll love that dynamic ads are constantly updating all on their own. There’s no need for you to create and launch multiple campaigns because machine learning has this taken care of for you.Retargeting:When users visit your website or app but don’t make a purchase, dynamic ads can be incredibly helpful for retargeting them and moving them farther down the sales funnel.Find new shoppers:Some users may show interest in your products or services (or those similar to the ones you offer) even though they have never visited your website or used your app. Dynamic ads help you target these users thanks to broad audience targeting!2. Facebook Multi-Product AdsNext, yourFacebook Adsfor eCommerce will also benefit from utilizing Facebook multi-product ads. The wonderful thing about these ads is that they let you show multiple products within the same ad. So, if a consumer spots one pair of rain boots in your multi-product ad, they can scroll through and see similar products they might be even more interested in.Alternatively, you can use multi-product ads to show different features of a single product, rather than showing multiple products. You can incorporate these as Dynamic Ads or create unique ad sets for yourself.3. Install the Conversion Tracking PixelAnother strategy worth implementing is installing the conversion tracking pixel. What is this, you ask? As confusing as it sounds, the idea is pretty simple: this pixel is a small piece of code you add to your website to track users’ behavior. It can tell you things like how that user got there, the pages and products they visit, and much more.Take a look at some more helpful infoFacebook offers upabout this eCommerce strategy:“Tracked conversions appear in theFacebook Ads Managerand theFacebook Analyticsdashboard, where they can be used to analyze the effectiveness of your conversion funnel and to calculate your return on ad investment. You can also use tracked conversions to definecustom audiencesfor ad optimization anddynamic adcampaigns. Once you have defined custom audiences, we can use them to identify other Facebook users who are likely to convert and target them with your ads.There are three ways to track conversions with the pixel:standard events, which are visitor actions that we have defined and that you report by calling a pixel functioncustom events, which are visitor actions that you have defined and that you report by calling a pixel functioncustom conversions, which are visitor actions that are tracked automatically by parsing your website’s referrer URLs”4. Run retargeting campaignsHow many times have you been browsing products online and add items to your cart, only to abandon the cart altogether and move on to something else? After doing this, you might start noticing you see Facebook Ads for the specific items you had in your cart. This is likely due to the business utilizing Facebook Ads for an eCommercestrategyknown as retargeting.These retargeting ads are a helpful reminder to people who have already shown interest in your product. Perhaps they got busy or distracted but had every intention to make a purchase. Your retargeting campaign could be just the push they need to finally make that purchase.5. Create a Lookalike AudienceFacebook is incredibly clever. They know what consumers like and what they want based on similar people’s actions and online behavior. Luckily, you can utilize this cleverness to your own advantage. When you create a Lookalike Audience for your Facebook Ads, you’re putting all of the data Facebook collects about users to work for you.Based on past customers’ behavior, their algorithms know which other users might also be interested in your products or services. Then, you can create an ad campaign to specifically target those individuals.6. Tell Your Brand Story with Video Facebook Ads for eCommerceNot every ad needs to be pushing a specific product or service to users. Did you know you can also use Facebook Ads to connect with consumers and tell your brand story?We don’t recommend overwhelming users with lengthy backstories. But a short video that tells your brand’s story can work wonders in establishing your brand presence and recognition.7. Custom audiences are a great way to strengthen customer relationshipsJust because someone has purchased your products once, doesn’t mean your work is done. You can keep working on connecting and engaging with them through the use of custom audiences for your Facebook Ads campaigns.AsFacebook explains:“A Custom Audience made from a customer list is a type of audience you can create to connect with people who have already shown an interest in your business or product. It’s made of information – called “identifiers” – you’ve collected about your customers (such as email, phone number, and address) and provided to Facebook. Prior to use, Facebookhashesthis information.Then, we use a process called matching to match the hashed information with Facebook profiles so that you can advertise to your customers on Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network. The more information you can provide, the better the match rate (which means our ability to make the matches). Facebook doesn’t learn any new identifying information about your customers.”There you have it!

It’s clear that Facebook is prioritizing video content, and that means it would be most beneficial to focus on using videos while running Facebook ads for e-commerce businesses. Videos are more likely to make your audience feel connected with the content, which in turn will help them engage with your ad better.This is a short ad for clothing brand Folk’s Spring 2022 collection – and spring is the message it’s trying to convey with the simple, dreamy cinematography of a man riding his cycle through the countryside. The music, too, adds the feel of a lazy spring afternoon. These elements really set the tone for the kind of feeling the brand wants to bring out in the customer.It’s okay if you can’t create a high-quality video from scratch – you don’t need to. You can work on a simple yet effective idea that your customers will relate to and will draw them in to give you clicks and conversions. You’ll need to have an effectivescriptandstoryboard: if you articulate these two building blocks of your video well, the execution of yourad ideawill be a lot smoother. After that, you’ll need toeither film the shotsor use stock footage that you can turn into a stunning video with minimal effort usingInVideo’s Ad Maker!Pro-Tip:Visually, short looping ads can be quite eye-catching. These video ads are short (under 15 seconds), so they don’t need to hold the customer’s attention for too long. Such videos are fun, consistently watchable, and they’ll make sure that the audience remembers your e-commerce brand.Here’sa template fromInVideothat you can use to replicate such a catchy, looping video style in your own e-commerce Facebook ad. Check out this example below to learn more!Pure Pet Food’s 5-second ad is a perfect example of how you can make a short ad that’s to the point and rewatchable. They begin with a great visual of their pet food and the tagline ‘Everything your dog needs in one tasty dish’. They have a straightforward CTA that says ‘Try today with 50% off’ – which prompts the viewer to at least check out such a compelling offer.Strategy #2: Use thumb-stopping images for your still adsIf you are using still images in your Facebook ads for e-commerce, you need to make sure that they are eye-catching and super high-quality. You want to wow your audience and display your product or service in the most attractive manner possible. While videos help personalize your brand, images can help you capture attention by putting your best foot forward.Laneige is a Korean beauty brand whose aesthetics have really caught the cosmetic industry’s eye – and this Facebook ad example explains why! With this bright and peppy ad displaying some of their lip products, Laneige really makes sure that they use a simple yet stunning image that reels customers into taking action.Incorporating pictures of people (especially happy people) is also important – you are, at the end of the day, trying to connect with a human at the other end of the screen. Apart from that, you need to make sure that your pictures are bright and full of color if you want them to be eye-catching. You can go for a minimalist look if that’s the tone of your brand, but remember that your ad should look sharp and clean instead of dull.You can add text to your image, but a good thing to keep in mind would be to limit the text to just about 20% of your entire image space. Ensure that your image text engages your readers. It has to be concise, clear, and catchy. Here are two key things you need to do for that:1) Use CTA words that trigger clicks:Using strong and powerful words creates a sense of urgency in your clients, which pushes them to act faster and provides a path with the least resistance to them. Some examples for this would be phrases like ‘limited time only’, ‘don’t miss out’, ‘last chance’, ‘offer expires’, and ‘one day only’.2)Embed Facebook CTAs:Facebook lets you embed different calls to action into your ad that can directly link to your ad objective – whether it be to your website, a sign-up, download, or make a direct purchase. You need to choose the CTA that is relevant to your brand and the goal of your ad campaign.A great example of an ad that includes both of these things is the luxury street footwear brand Flipped’s simple picture ad. The ad mentions ‘Limited stocks only’ and then offers a 22% off sale. They embed a CTA link to their e-commerce store with the phrase ‘Shop Now’. In doing this, Flipped optimized their ad to be extremely to the point – displaying only the most crucial information and creating both a sense of urgency and an incentive to buy during their sale.Strategy #3: Show social proof in your adsSocial proof is everything when running Facebook ads for e-commerce. When you put up an ad that includes real-life customers talking about how they’ve benefitted from your product, it makes all the difference. First, it features real people – something that makes your ad more authentic and more attractive on Facebook. Second, since word of mouth is such an important strategy, hearing from other customers is crucial to making your audience trust your brand.Testimonialand product review ads are an excellent way to convince a skeptical audience to consider buying your product or service. This is also the reason influencer advertising is so popular – people put their trust in the influencers that they follow, and they are likely to buy something that is recommended to them by someone they trust. But you don’t need a famous person to endorse your product – just having your best customers talk about how your product has made a difference to them is more than enough.Glossier has taken the social proof strategy to another level by getting a credible dermatologist and skincare expert to review their After Baume product. They display the product and the testimonial with great camera angles that show the product in use as well as the happy customer. Watching a trusted expert review a product and express their satisfaction with it is a great way to make your e-commerce brand seem reliable.Creating testimonial ads isn’t difficult either. If you want to create something like Glossier’s ad, you will need some of your customers to provide you with a video review of your product. You can then turn that into a compelling video ad using a templatelike this onefrom InVideo. Alternatively, if your customers aren’t comfortable in front of the camera and can only give in written reviews, you can usethis templateto turn those into a great testimonial ad.Strategy #4: Convey your brand’s key messageFacebook is a social networking platform before it’s an advertising platform. That means that you need to lean into the ‘people marketing’ aspect of Facebook and appeal to customers with your brand’s story. As an e-commerce brand, you don’t have a retail store around which you can build a community. To leverage your brand’s key message, you need to have an ad that tells agood storythat people can connect with. Adding a personal touch to your advertising is crucial in building relationships with future customers.One way to do this is through agood videoad that tells your brand’s story or relays the main objective of your business. A good example among Facebook e-commerce ads is Nike’s ‘Greatness is never done’ campaign. As a high-profile sports brand, Nike has always created ad campaigns that inspire their audience to buy their products on their own journey to greatness. This is a simple ad with a message that sparks curiosity, and it ends with a CTA that prompts viewers to download and check out the Nike App.Since you’re able to employ your customer base’s demographic information through Facebook, you’ll get a good idea of the kind of person your average customer is. Use that to your advantage and create an ad that shows off the kind of persona someone can achieve by being your customer. By showing the impact that using your product can have on your audience’s daily life, you’re making your audiences interested in a lifestyle and a personality they want, not just your product.This vlog-style Glossier ad is a great example of this point. The ad is emotional and evokes a certain kind of ‘dreamy’ lifestyle, and it also tells the story of the kind of customer who benefits from their product. It also manages to showcase the product perfectly while displaying the customer’s story. They display their Eau de parfum, Glossier You, in use, and show a loving relationship with the ad campaign ‘The Better With You Duo’.Another way to create a story-based ad is to show the different use cases or benefits of your product or service. This way, you’ll be able to target and catch the interest of people with a variety of problems. Solving your customer’s problems is the best way for them to be convinced that they should purchase your product: it creates a need for them that can be fulfilled by your product or service.Dance sneaker brand Fuego’s cool video ad is the perfect example of this. Their ad is 30 seconds long, with attention-grabbing visuals and a catchy beat. They manage to showcase their product really well and also show the different ways that it can be used for both dancing and everyday life.Pro-Tip:For story-based ads, you will need to pay a lot of attention to your scripting and storyboarding in order to be able to convey your message exactly as you want. Once that part is taken care of, you can go ahead and useInVideo’s Ad Makeralong with the huge collection of stock assets to create a stunning ad that helps you get better conversions.Here’sa template you can use to make a similar, simple video ad that conveys your brand message.Strategy #5: Design mobile-first adsDuring a recent social experiment, AdEspresso found that mobile ad placements outperformed desktop by over45%. This means that the best and most successful Facebook ads for e-commerce are designed with mobile use in mind. This means you need to useverticalimages and videos that are formatted for mobile. You should also put important information at the beginning of your ad copy since text cuts off earlier on mobile. Another thing to keep in mind is to optimize your landing pages for the mobile experience too.Here’s an example of a mobile-friendly ad by H&M. Its aspect ratio is vertical, and it’s a 6-second video full of dance and bright colors – something that makes the ad eye-catching to viewers who are just scrolling through Facebook on their phone. Since H&M is promoting their new color pop-inspired activewear collection, they add the tagline ‘Get shaped by the beat’ – a line that fits both with the dance and the clothing line.The last thing you can do is useclips shot on yourmobileinstead of using a professional camera – this makes your video look more authentic and blend in with the Facebook feed. What’s more, it also helps you to cut down on the high cost of professionally shot videos. These work best forStories Ads, and they resemble user-generated content very strongly, increasing their level of personalization.To make a simple vlog-style product ad like this one with minimal effort, you can check out InVideo’stemplate Librarywhich has 5000+ pre-made templates to help you make stunning professional videos with ease.Here’sa template that we think would work really well for this style of ad!Strategy #6: Run Giveaway AdsOne of the best ways to get an ad to perform well is to make sure that your audience engages with it heavily. And giveaways are an excellent way to promote your brand more. They help you to grow your network, boost your brand exposure, build an audience, drive site traffic, and strengthen your brand’s relationship with your customers. You must choose giveaway prizes that are relevant to reel in your community and target audiences. Additionally, you’ll need to set your objectives for the giveaway – this will enable you to decide what action you need your audience to take to enter the giveaway.A great example of a giveaway ad is the luxury lingerie brand Sevigne ad. They are to the point in their ad copy as well as in their accompanying creative, which has the word ‘WIN’ in big bold letters – something that’s bound to get viewers interested.And if you want to create a similar simple animated ad for your product,InVideo’s got just thetemplatefor you. All you need to do is go over to theInVideo Ad Makerand start editing!You can do even more to raise engagement when running Facebook ads for e-commerce. Things like building referral programs, promoting your own content more, hosting contests and giveaways for your audience, and having offers for your products or services are all good tactics for this.Strategy #7: Focus on abandoned carts and retargeting campaignsOften, customers abandon their carts before checkout and purchase. The average cart abandonment rate across all e-commerce industries is69.89%. That means that your product interested someone enough to visit your website, browse, and make a choice, but not purchase it. There can be lots of reasons why someone abandoned their cart before making a purchase, and most of them may be subjective to the consumers’ personal lives. Regardless, that’s a huge loss for e-commerce brands.In that case, you can re-target these customers via Facebook ads in a way that they come back and complete the purchase. A great strategy to do this is by re-targeting them with an ad that announces a discount on their in-cart items, making it more tempting for them to buy.Here’s an example of an ad by Camera Ready Cosmetics offering a small discount with the caption ‘You deserve this’ – indicating that the customer is already familiar with the brand. The ad provides a promo code for the customer to use the discount. The image of the ad itself focuses on two important points: the 15% discount, and the fact that it’s only for two days. They display some of their best-selling products and attach a CTA that says ‘Shop Now’. Such a strategy is likely to give interested customers the final push into making a purchase and getting you that conversion!Even if you can’t offer a discount, retargeting customers with different Facebook ads for e-commerce is likely to bring them back to your website to make a purchase. Website visitors who are retargeted are43%more likely to convert!Strategy #8: Use Dynamic Product AdsDynamic Product Adsare another feature that Facebook offers that you can use in your retargeting campaigns. Using this feature shows tailored ads to customers that have visited your site. Dynamic ads enable you to automatically promote your entire product catalog across Facebook without having to create thousands of individual ads. For e-commerce brands that have a large inventory of products, this is an incredibly helpful and efficient way to target many different customers who are all shopping for products completely different from each other.All you have to do for this is upload your product catalog and relevant product information toFacebook Business Manager, and use Custom Audiences and modify it to report on the buying behavior of your customers. Then you will be able to create a dynamic template to display Facebook ads for e-commerce to customers who have viewed specific products on your website already.Here’s an example of a multi-product ad – this is the format in which dynamic ads are displayed too. If your customer looking at any shoes from Borjan Shoes on their website, they would show up again on Facebook like this to prompt the buyer to go back and buy them.To understand how you can use Facebook ads to your advantage, check out thiscomprehensive guide.Strategy #9: Leverage Facebook’s Custom Audiences to your advantageFacebook Custom Audiences is an ad targeting option for e-commerce Facebook ads that allows you to find your existing audiences among people who are on Facebook. This is essentially a list of people who already know about or have engaged with your business in some way or the other. Retaining customers and getting repeat customers is the most efficient way to generate consistent sales, and for an e-commerce brand, Facebook’s Custom Audiences acts as the bridge to connect with those customers.You can create different types ofCustom AudienceLists on Facebook through your website data, app activity data, using your customer lists and databases, and through Facebook’s engagement insights. Doing this will help you to target customers that have an interest in your brand and have already viewed your website, products, or services.Something you can do is target your Custom Audience lists with Facebook ads for e-commerce that offer discounts – since they already know about your brand and product, they already have interest in what you are offering. An additional discount can become an incentive that closes the deal without too much pushy marketing, instead of letting an interested customer go.Here’s an example of the children’s clothing brand Engine targeting parents with young children with the tagline ‘Shop for your tiny ones from Engine’, followed by a flat discount of 50% and 70% to increase the incentive for parents to shop. The ad ends with the line ‘start their fashion journey with a bang’ – appealing to parents who are looking for nice clothes for their children.Strategy #10: Use Interests and Lookalike Audiences to find new customersYou can do two different things to find new customers that would be as interested in your brand as your already existing customer base. The crux of this is that you’ll need to target new people who share similar characteristics to your existing customers. If you target an audience that is not fully interested in your business, they won’t be very receptive to your e-commerce Facebook advertising, no matter how good the content of your ad is.Using theInterestsfield on Facebook, you can make sure that you are targeting the niche that is relevant for your business. Make sure to select a narrow interest, and nothing too broad. With multiple different specific, niche interests, you’ll be able to make sure you target customers that are invested followers of what you are trying to sell.TheLookalike Audiencesfeature that Facebook offers is even better: they use their data and the algorithm to find new people who have qualities and interests similar to your existing customers. One tip that Facebook offers is to make your audience from only your best customers instead of your entire customer pool – you may get better results doing this, especially when efficient digital marketing is key for running Facebook ads for e-commerce.Strategy #11: Optimize your analytics with Facebook Pixel and Conversions APIFacebook offers many tools for e-commerce brands to optimize their analytics. Two of them are Facebook Pixel and Conversions API.The Facebook Pixel is a piece of code for your website that helps Facebook gather data on the customer activity on your website. Through Facebook Pixel, you can reach customers who take any kind of action after seeing your ad on Facebook. Over time, the algorithm gets better at delivering your ads to people who are more likely to take certain actions.The Conversions API is a similar tool, but it’s made to take your brand’s marketing data into account along with Facebook’s systems that help optimize ad targeting and decrease costs per action across Meta technologies.Both of these tools require some setup and specialization but optimizing your analytics is the best way to make sure your ad runs efficiently. The key with Facebook ads for e-commerce is to give your ads enough time to start learning and automating a lot of the market analysis for you.For a better understanding of how to use Facebook Pixel and master retargeting, check out this comprehensive video:Strategy #12: Make your life easier with Facebook Automated RulesFollowing the previous strategy, Facebook’s Automated Rules is another advanced tool you can use to let your ads essentially run efficiently by themselves. You need to create rules for your ads, but these can help you manage multiple ads at the same time. Through Automated Rules, Facebook automatically checks your campaigns and ads and updates or notifies you of any changes. This can cut down on the time you need to manage your ads.You can create rules like automatically pausing underperforming Facebook ads for e-commerce, increasing the budget on well-performing ad sets, and decreasing your budget on poorly performing ads. Creating these rules takes a certain amount of time, but they can save you both time and money on the actual running of the ads. That being said, you still need to monitor the overall performance of your ads to make sure that they are meeting your marketing goals.Here’s a video that explains this concept more in depth along with several other Facebook ads strategies that you might find useful for your e-commerce business:Now that you know the different strategies that will help you create effective Facebook ads for your e-commerce business, it’s time to learnhowto make an ad that will engage your audience and help you drive conversions.
